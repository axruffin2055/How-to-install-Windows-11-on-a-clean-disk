# How-to-install-Windows-11-on-a-clean-disk.  

Introduction  
Guys and gals, before we get into this, I highly recommend installing a Linux Operating System (OS) on a USB.  
Why install another OS on an USB, when you already have an OS? Because if you embark on this quest:  
"How-to-install-Windows-11-on-a-clean-disk." and things do not go as planned such as technology decides  
that it does not want to configurate software or hardware for whatever reasons, then you may need to  
download software, or fix the problems using another OS with internet. It is better to have an OS backup  
if by change while working on this project, Windows 11 will not boot up. Also, please do not panic because I got you covered:

This link will help with installing Ubuntu on a USB. Now on to this project.  

Installing Windows 11 on a clean disk is useful when starting fresh, wiping out preinstalled bloatware,  
dual-booting with Linux, or recovering from severe system issues. A clean install ensures no leftover system  
clutter or malware and gives you complete control over disk partitioning. For instance, the need to gain more  
disk space for the Linux OS on Windows 11 disk was reason enough to wipe the disk and gain better control  
toward the dual-booting quest.
