The wipef way.
Using wipefs to clear all filesystem signatures:
The -a flag removes all identifiable filesystem signatures (like NTFS, ext4, etc.)
sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdX   (Replace /dev/sdX with your target disk such as /dev/sda, or /dev/nvme0n1)

the parted way.
Using parted to remove all partitions and reinitialize disk:
